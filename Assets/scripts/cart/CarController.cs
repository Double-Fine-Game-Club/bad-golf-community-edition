	// This car component is designed to be used on a gameobject which has wheels attached.
	// The wheels must be child objects, and each have a Wheel script attached, and a WheelCollider component.

	// Even though wheelcolliders have their own settings for grip loss, this car script (and its accompanying
	// wheel scripts) modify the settings on the wheelcolliders at runtime, to give a more exaggerated and fun
	// experience, allowing burnouts and drifting behavior in a way that is not readily achievable using
	// constant values on wheelcolliders alone.

	// The code priorities fun over realism, and although a gears system is included, it is not used to 
	// 'drive' the engine. Instead, the current revs and gear are calculated retrospectively based
	// on the car's current speed. These gear and rev values can then be read and used by a GUI or Sound component.
